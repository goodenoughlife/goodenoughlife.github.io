						<h2>Background</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Since 2018, I have been on a mission to accomplish a (seemingly) simple thing: live a good enough life. After a childhood filled with trauma, I found myself, 21, in a predicament; I WANTED to live, but bouts of severe anxiety, dread, self-doubt, inability to focus, paranoia, and intense mood swings had overtaken my day to day life. I dedicated most of 2019 to stabilizing through psychodynamic therapy, meditation, yoga, fellowship, and psych literature. In 2020 during the global pandemic, I entered a relationship that helped bring my stability to new heights. Fast foward to the end of 2023, and that relationship ended in a situation mirroring the trauma of my childhood, and I found myself unstable again. This website is documentation of part 2 of my healing journey.</p>

						<h2>Current Approach</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I am currently exploring Janina Fisher's structural dissociation model, which is the central focus of her TSIT modality. The goal is to get the client to unblend with their traumatized parts and to allow the "normal life self" to act as a compassionate moderator for each of the parts, valuing their respective usefulness at a point in time. With a focus on sensorimotor techniques, she aims for clients to gain earned secure attachment through reparenting of traumatized parts.</p>

									- She has trouble feeling safe and calming down and tries to sleep in her mom’s bed most nights but it always kicked out.
									<br>
									- Tries to be perfect so her mom won’t need to worry about her.

									- She is obsessed with God, begging him to save her and her family, writing prayers for the angels in chalk in the clubhouse her Daddy built her. 
									<br>
									- Her Mom is always criticizing her intelligence, behavior, and physical appearance. She always feels like she did something wrong.

									- She spends her nights sleeping under her bed or in her closet because she feels safer there than in her bed. She has nightmares about caterpillars and her phobia is so severe that she refuses to go in the backyard during the month of May.
									<br>
									- She doesn’t trust others and always assume they hate her.
									<br>
									- She shuts down when overwhelmed and her world becomes blurry and her memory fails." alt="" /></a>

									<br>
									- She is an over-achiever who shuts out all feelings and can't not be *doing*.
									<br>
									- She lacks feelings and has tunnel vision towards being in control of her life again (lol at this website)."  alt="" /></a>

									- She is an engineer with a love for art, music, nature, psychology, sociology, ancient history and the intersection of those disciplines. 
									<br>
									- She is hardworking, having recieved an exceeding expectations rating at work 5 review cycles in a row.
									<br>
									- She uses her skills for a greater good, from fixing resumes for friends, to placing in AI pitch competitions and performing research for academic publications (helping environment / aiding civil rights protestors), to web scraping for missing persons cases (Elaine Park / SC John Doe).
									<br>
									- She is a gay socialist anti-capitalist Bernie Sanders style leftist who has proudly cut all conservatives out of her life.
									<br>
									- She has child-like faith in the goodness of others, and no matter how messy life gets, she finds a way to survive and thrive. "  alt="" /></a>
