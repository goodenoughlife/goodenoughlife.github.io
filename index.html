						<h2>Background</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Since 2018, I have been on a mission to accomplish a (seemingly) simple thing: live a good enough life. After a childhood filled with trauma and teenage years dominated by SI, I found myself, 21, in a predicament; I WANTED to live, but bouts of severe anxiety, dread, self-doubt, inability to focus, paranoia, and intense mood swings had overtaken my day to day life. I dedicated most of 2019 to stabilizing through psychodynamic therapy, meditation, yoga, fellowship, and reading psychology, sociology and neuroscience literature. In 2020 during the global pandemic, I entered a relationship that helped bring my stability to new heights and I paused my healing journey. Fast foward to the end of 2023, and that relationship ended in a situation mirroring the trauma of my childhood, and I found myself unstable again for the first time in years. This website is documentation of part 2 of my healing journey.</p>

						<h2>Trauma Disorders</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Anxiety? Depression? OCD? Borderline Personality Disorder? Bipolar Disorder? ADHD? Autism?..... CPTSD ? I have never felt a strong desire to be seen as having a specific mental health disorder. I identify as a "Long Term Trauma Survivor With A Cluster Fuck of Trauma Symptoms", which appears to be best represented in the (very limited) CPTSD literature. I do not believe any modality of therapy is the golden solution, and every statistic points to the client-therapist relationship being the most important factor in progress. A part of me yearns to understand what each of the never-ending trauma modality acronyms (CBT,DBT,ACT,EMDR,SE,EFT,TIST,IFS) can offer, yet holistic approaches & non-sponsored and evidence-based (and what even is evidence?) information is almost impossible to come by. My goal is to research the over-arching themes. My goal is to be able to explain what I learn to somebody who has never picked up a psychology book. My goal is to heal; to share this information and these free resources.</p>

				    <p>"The essence of structural dissociation is perfection of the ability to distance from affect in order not to become overwhelmed. Whenever emotions become unmanageable, a neurological circuit-breaker system facilitates an automatic “switch” to another, more tolerable feeling state held by a different part." - Janina Fisher</p>

									"<b>Who is she?</b>
									<br>
									- Doesn’t understand why her mom is kind one moment, gets mad and pulls her hair the next, and then is sad and locks her out of her bedroom and ignores her. She has trouble feeling safe and calming down and sleeps in her mom’s bed most nights.
									- Tries to be perfect so her mom won’t need to worry about her.
									<br>
									<b>How has she healed in adulthood?</b>
									<br>
									- First, Sarah (for better or worse) showed her what love was. She held and nurtured her and was dependable, even after the confusing break up.
									- Second, the (mostly) mentally stable friends she made her first year of college have consistently cared about her since 2015. Through every heartbreak, period of self-isolation, creeping paranoia that they secretly hate her and change in personality, they have continued to invite her to events and be kind to her. Victoria cuddles with her, holds her hand, ends every outing with “I love you”, and when black out drunk, introduces herself to others as “her (Kasey) dumb bitch.”
									- Third, living with Cheyenne and next door to Julie, Lettice and Pippi showed her what a (for a time) stable family could look like. One without yelling, one without shame, one filled with love and laughs, day in and day out.
									<br>
									<b>How does she struggle in adulthood?</b>
									<br>
									- When in a relationship, she is happy. She is quiet, leaves the other parts alone, and calms down the nervous system so it is less hyper vigilant. When outside of a relationship, she feels insecure and lonely and activates the other parts and the nervous system, yelling to them that we are not safe. She is scared of getting close to people because she believes they will always abandon her, so, when insecure, she pushes people away." alt="" /></a>
