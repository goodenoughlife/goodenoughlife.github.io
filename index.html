						<h2>Background</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Since 2018, I have been on a mission to accomplish a (seemingly) simple thing: live a good enough life. After a childhood filled with trauma and teenage years dominated by SI, I found myself, 21, in a predicament; I WANTED to live, but bouts of severe anxiety, dread, self-doubt, inability to focus, paranoia, and intense mood swings had overtaken my day to day life. I dedicated most of 2019 to stabilizing through psychodynamic therapy, meditation, yoga, fellowship, and reading psychology, sociology and neuroscience literature. In 2020 during the global pandemic, I entered a relationship that helped bring my stability to new heights and I paused my healing journey. Fast foward to the end of 2023, and that relationship ended in a situation mirroring the trauma of my childhood, and I found myself unstable again for the first time in years. This website is documentation of part 2 of my healing journey.</p>

						<h2>Trauma Disorders</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Anxiety? Depression? OCD? Borderline Personality Disorder? Bipolar Disorder? ADHD? Autism?..... CPTSD ? I have never felt a strong desire to be seen as having a specific mental health disorder. I identify as a "Long Term Trauma Survivor With A Cluster Fuck of Trauma Symptoms", which appears to be best represented in the (very limited) CPTSD literature. I do not believe any modality of therapy is the golden solution, and every statistic points to the client-therapist relationship being the most important factor in progress. A part of me yearns to understand what each of the never-ending trauma modality acronyms (CBT,DBT,ACT,EMDR,SE,EFT,TIST,IFS) can offer, yet holistic approaches & non-sponsored and evidence-based (and what even is evidence?) information is almost impossible to come by. My goal is to research the over-arching themes. My goal is to be able to explain what I learn to somebody who has never picked up a psychology book. My goal is to heal; to share this information and these free resources.</p>

									<br>
									- She is shy in school and she hates being called on in class because it means people will be looking at her.  
									<br>
									- She spends her nights sleeping under her bed or in her closet because she feels safer there than in her bed. She has nightmares about caterpillars and her phobia is so severe that she refuses to go in the backyard during the month of May.
									<br>
									- She doesn’t trust others and always assume they hate her.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>How does she struggle in adulthood?</b>
									<br>
									- When outside of a relationship, she feels insecure and lonely and activates the other parts, yelling to them that we are not safe and that we need somebody to pay attention to us. 
									<br>
									- She causes panic attacks. During traumatic events, she induces dissociation until she is safe again. " alt="" /></a>

									<br>
									- She is obsessed with God. 
									<br>
									- She spends her days singing songs to God asking to die if he will save Katelynn, writing prayers asking to be saved in chalk in the clubhouse her Daddy built her, and trying to be good.
									<br>
									- She believes something is wrong with her. Matthew hurts her all the time, and when he starts molesting her, the grownups don’t stop it in part because “Matthew is disabled and we need to be kind to him” and in part because she doesn’t have the right words to tell them what is happening. Her mom is always telling her she is cold-hearted like her violent loner addict (paternal) Uncle Kalon, a mean person like Matthew, and not kind like Christie.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>How does she struggle in adulthood?</b>
									<br>
									- She is the “loudest” of the parts today. She feels guilty all the time and triggers lots of brain fog making it hard to focus on work. She apologizes to inanimate objects, she apologizes when nervous and she has little understanding of what things she should actually feel guilty about. "  alt="" /></a>

									- Doesn’t understand why her mom is kind one moment, gets mad and pulls her hair the next, and then is sad and locks her out of her bedroom and ignores her. 
									<br>
									- She has trouble feeling safe and calming down and sleeps in her mom’s bed most nights.
									<br>
									- Tries to be perfect so her mom won’t need to worry about her.
